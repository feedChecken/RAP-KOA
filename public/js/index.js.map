The value of field after the call minus the value of field before the\n   *  call is amount, modulo any overflow that has occurred in field\n   *  Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its range and,\n   *  as a result, the next larger field is incremented or\n   *  decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range.\n   *\n   *  - Add rule 2. If a smaller field is expected to be invariant,\n   *  but it is impossible for it to be equal to its\n   *  prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after\n   *  field is changed, then its value is adjusted to be as close\n   *  as possible to its expected value. A smaller field represents a\n   *  smaller unit of time. HOUR_OF_DAY is a smaller field than\n   *  DAY_OF_MONTH. No adjustment is made to smaller fields\n   *  that are not expected to be invariant.
